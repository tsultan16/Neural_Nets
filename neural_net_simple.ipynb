    "**Model 1:** We are given a set of instances with numerical attributes, and a numerical label/target value (i.e. ground truth) for each instance. POur goal is to create a neural network that can predict the label for any given instance. In our simplest neural network model, the prediction is just a linear combination of the attributes. The network is trained by optimizing the weights (i.e. constant co-efficients) of this linear combination using gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demo this model, we will use the \"traffic lights\" example, where we have three traffic lights, the state of each light is either `on` or `off` (i.e. 1 or 0) and the corresponding label is either walk or stop (1 or 0). The training dataset is contrived such that there is a strong correlation between the second attribute/light and the target. We would therefore expect the second weight to be much larger than the other two weights after the model has been trained sufficiently. "

    "**Model 2:** We will now build a neural network with one hidden-layer, between the input and output layers, and introduce non-linearity via a relu activation function. This three layer network has two sets of weights, both of which are optimized during training. That training phase has two separate stages: a forward propagation and a backward propagation. Forward propagation involves computing the output at the end of each layer and sending them forward to be the inputs for the next layer. Backward propagatiuon involves computing the derivatives w.r.t. the inputs of the operation performed at each layer, composing these derivatives with those obtained from the next layer, and then sending these back to the previous layer. This composition of derivatives from the current layer with derivatives from the next layer is simply the application of the chain-rule for derivatives.  "
