    "**Convolutional Neural Network**:\n",
    "We will now replace the hidden layer from our simple neural network model with a `convolutional layer`. In the usual hidden layer, we multiply the input vector `L0` with a weights matrix `W0`. When the input size is large, i.e. each instance has a large number of feature attributes (e.g. in the case of image data with lots of pixels), we end up with a large number of weights in `W0`. This can lead to the model overfitting the training data and lower the accuracy of the predictions. This problem can be mitigated by introducing a smaller weights matrix, also called a `kernel`, and applying this `kernel` repeatedly over different subsections of the data. So for example, if we have a 28x28 (=784) pixel image input, then instead of multiplying with a weight matrix with 28x28 rows, we can use a 6x6 kernel and multiply it with every 6x6 subsection of the image. We can also use multiple different kernels to process the inputs and pass on a combination of the different kernel outputs onto the next layer.         "
